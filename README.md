# BogoSort Server

## Description

These are server and client files that are done using java.net. You can use this for any sorting algorithm but I chose bogo sort as it can actually take a while to finish. 

## How to Use

### Changing the IP

Currently the IP is set to localhost in the Client.java file so you'd either have to type in the IP that your server is on locally or on the internet.

### Running the server

If you are like me and are using a Linux server to run it you can run it with a simple script using nohup. The server will continue to run until closed or something goes wrong so make sure to close if necessary.

### Using the client

If you are using the client software, you can use the command 'finished' to call on the server for time taken. It will also tell you if it is finished or not as well as finish time.

## Why was this created?

I wanted to run my friend's bogo sort on a server so I could do it in the background. I am just sharing the source files with you all.
